This is a project from the university, that i participatе - the SoftUniversity of Bulgaria.
The Genarator is write in a C# language and the sentence that is generated is based ot the folowing model:
</p>

__`Sentence`__ = `Who` + `Action` + `Detail`. <br/>
- Where the **`Who`** is generated from a random `name` and a `place`.<br/>
- The **`Action`** is based from a random `verb`, `noun` and a `adverb`.<br/>
- The **`Detail`** is a random generated `detail`, that is written in the code.<br/>
